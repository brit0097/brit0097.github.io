            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>Hello! I'm <abbr title="Isabella">Bella</abbr>, a 23-year-old from Brazil, starting this new chapter in Canada! Oh, and I'm the 1<sup>st</sup> one from my family to live abroad - <em>pretty exciting, eh?</em></p>
            <p>Let's start by talking about my journey until here... I graduated with a degree in Law, but my heart wasn't in it, so I decided to explore new fields. The push to explore new avenues came from my husband, who's immersed in the world of IT. It all started with him telling me more about the possible careers in the world of technology. Observing him at work and sitting in on meetings at his job, I discovered my affinity for the creative aspects of technology - which wasn't a total surprise, as I have always enjoyed drawing and making things up since childhood.</p>
            <p>I am enjoying every single course of this Interactive Media Design program, something that really surprised me, as I don't even have a favorite subject yet! Another thing that I love about college is the social interactions - despite being an introvert. Meeting people from diverse cultures and backgrounds makes me feel happy.</p>
            <p>And last but not least, I'd like to share my excitement for all the winter activities I'm starting to try now - sledding, skating, skiing... <em>Well, I haven't tried skiing yet, but I am really excited about the possibility of doing so.</em> Everything here is so different from Brazil, and I am really enjoying my time. I hope to enjoy every season here!</p>
